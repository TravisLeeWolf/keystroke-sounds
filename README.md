# Keypress sound player
### Greetings
Hi, I'm a developer and enjoy making apps to help make little things a little better. In this case I wanted to be able to stream without using my mic to capture keypresses on a mechanical keyboard. So I made this programme, it plays back keypresses and mouseclicks.

### How to use
- Copy the source code and run it in your terminal, or you can clone it from GitHub
- Once copied, just open a terminal/cmd from the project folder
- From there use 'python main.py' to start the program
- As long as it's open an running it will continue to play in the background
